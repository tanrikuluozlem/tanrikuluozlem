# Hey there, I'm [Özlem Tanrıkulu] 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm  DevOps Engineer with a passion for cloud tech, automation, and optimizing systems for the best performance. When I'm not deep into code, you’ll likely find me enjoying sports or diving into new tech trends.

## 🚀 About Me
I love working with tools like Kubernetes, Docker, and AWS to build scalable and resilient systems. But I’m not just about the tools—I’m all about helping teams collaborate and automate the tedious stuff so we can focus on the fun challenges.

In my free time, I like to explore new technologies, write blog posts, and stay active by playing sports or hitting the gym. I believe in lifelong learning and am always up for a challenge!

## 🌱 What I'm Currently Working On
- Building CI/CD pipelines that just work—reliable, fast, and easy to maintain.
- Exploring new cloud-native tools and technologies.
- Writing blog posts to share my DevOps journey.
